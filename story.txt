RaftModding is the largest community for mods, scripts and utilities for the game Raft!
RaftModding provides an easy way to browse and install mods with a one click install solution.
RaftModding doesn't provide support for pirated versions. Please consider buying the game if you want to use our softwares!
RaftModding has 2 softwares :
- RaftModLoader is a launcher that you download from our site and allows you to keep your mod loader installation up to date and provide various features such as installing and loading mods, joining servers & more.
- RaftDedicatedServer is a software that allows you to run a raft world 24/7 on a dedicated server or your computer, As it is in alpha it is only available as a reward to our patreon supporters.

In order to install a mod, install our modloader if you haven't yet and then on the mod page click on the "Install mod" button, it'll open the launcher and proceed to the automatic installation.
After installing a mod, you have to start the game using the mod loader and in the game you have to load the mod in the mod manager, To load a mod click the plug icon in the mod manager page.
For security purposes mods are not automatically updated, each time a new mod update is available you have to download it manually OR you can use the mod ModUpdater by FranzFischer to get in-game updates.

The modloader menu can be by default opened with F9
The modloader console can be by default opened with F10

The mod manager have different status for mods : 
- Idle : The mod is not running/active.
- Running : The mod is running and should be working.
- Compiling : The mod is compiling.
- Errored : The mod is errored which means that it won't work. Please contact the mod author.

When you have an error it'll also be shown in the bottom right corner of the screen with the amount of errors, more details about the error can be obtained by pressing F10 and looking for red text/errors in the console.

RaftModLoader Known Issues : 
- Antivirus flagging the software, Our softwares are completely secure, the only reason your antivirus/browser complains is because we are injecting our modloader into the game and this is seen a malicious behaviour as some viruses seems to use this to hide into other applications. You can visit $web$api.raftmodding.com/tutorials/how-to-get-rid-of-virus-error to get help.
- If our softwares can't access a certain location of your computer you might be missing admin permissions or it could also be your antivirus blocking our softwaree. Please try to add our launcher as an exception in your antivirus. Most of the time its solved by doing this.
- The launcher UI is looking weird, This issue is generally fixed by setting the "Scale and Layout" option in the display settings to 100%.
- An error occured while fetching for updates, This issue is most of the time caused by ipv6 being enabled on your computer. Here's a guide $web$networking.grok.lsu.edu/Article.aspx?articleid=17573 After disabling it on your wifi and ethernet adapter restart your computer.
- getting a timed out error, This issue is probably related to your ISP blocking the connection to our website. To be sure thats the correct issue open the command prompt (by typing cmd.exe in the search bar and opening it) and run the following commands: `nslookup raftmodding.com` and `nslookup raftmodding.com 8.8.8.8` If the IP adresses are different then you will need to manually set the DNS to one that is not blacklisting us like google having the IP 8.8.8.8 Here's a guide on how to setup the google DNS on your system: $web$www.whatismyip.com/google-dns/ You might also need to change the DNS on your router though this will depend a lot on the one you have... After changing the DNS you might need to restart your computer for the changes to apply!
- Broken config A problem occured while updating the RaftModLoader config file. This issue is most likely related to the config file being broken. To fix it just delete the following file and restart the launcher: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\RaftModLoader\config.ini
