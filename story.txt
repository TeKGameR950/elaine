RaftModding is the largest community for mods, scripts and utilities for the game Raft!
RaftModding provides an easy way to browse and install mods with a one click install solution.

RaftModding has 2 softwares :
- RaftModLoader is a launcher that you download from our site and allows you to keep your mod loader installation up to date and provide various features such as installing and loading mods, joining servers & more.
- RaftDedicatedServer is a software that allows you to run a raft world 24/7 on a dedicated server or your computer, As it is in alpha it is only available as a reward to our patreon supporters.

In order to install a mod, install our modloader if you haven't yet and then on the mod page click on the "Install mod" button, it'll open the launcher and proceed to the automatic installation.
After installing a mod, you have to start the game using the mod loader and in the game you have to load the mod in the mod manager, To load a mod click the plug icon in the mod manager page.
For security purposes mods are not automatically updated, each time a new mod update is available you have to download it manually OR you can use the mod ModUpdater by FranzFischer to get in-game updates.

The modloader menu in-game can be by default opened with F9
The modloader console in-game can be by default opened with F10

The mod manager have different status for mods : 
- Idle : The mod is not running/active.
- Running : The mod is running and should be working.
- Compiling : The mod is compiling.
- Errored : The mod is errored which means that it won't work. Please contact the mod author.

When you have an error in-game it'll also be shown in the bottom right corner of the screen with the amount of errors, more details about the error can be obtained by pressing F10 and looking for red text/errors in the console.

How do mods works in Multiplayer :
Generally it depends on the mods.
Mods that adds new blocks/items or modify world generation require all players to have them installed.
Mods that only modify the local player only need to be installed by the client.
Mods that affect the physics or behaviours of objects other than the player only require the host to have it installed
If you have no mods installed that require all players to have them installed then you can play with users that do not have the mod loader.

The markdown table below are raft mod loader known issues. If there's a ; character it means its 2 different options. for example in the potential issues A;B means the issue is either A or B.
| Potential Issue | Potential Fix | Helpful Tag |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Antivirus blocking the launcher; File flagged as virus. | Our softwares are completely secure, the only reason your antivirus/browser complains is because we are injecting our modloader into the game and this is seen a malicious behaviour as some viruses seems to use this to hide into other applications. | $antivirus$ |
| Access denied; can't access location | If our softwares can't access a certain location of your computer you might be missing admin permissions or it could also be your antivirus blocking our softwaree. Please try to add our launcher as an exception in your antivirus. Most of the time its solved by doing this. | $antivirus$ |
| Broken config; A problem occured while updating the RaftModLoader config file | This issue is most likely related to the config file being broken. To fix it just delete the following file and restart the launcher: $config_path$ | $config$ |
| Game is pirated; game cracked | RaftModding doesn't provide support for pirated versions. Please consider buying the game if you want to use our softwares! | $pirate$ |
| An error occured while fetching for updates ; Timed Out | This issue is probably caused by ipv6 being enabled on your computer. It is most of the time solved by disabling it. After disabling it on your wifi and ethernet adapter restart your computer. | $ipv6$ |
