RaftModding is the largest community for mods, scripts and utilities for the game Raft!
RaftModding provides an easy way to browse and install mods with a one click install solution.

RaftModding has 2 softwares :
- RaftModLoader is a launcher that you download from our site and allows you to keep your mod loader installation up to date and provide various features such as installing and loading mods, joining servers & more.
- RaftDedicatedServer is a software that allows you to run a raft world 24/7 on a dedicated server or your computer, As it is in alpha it is only available as a reward to our patreon supporters.

In order to install a mod, install our modloader if you haven't yet and then on the mod page click on the "Install mod" button, it'll open the launcher and proceed to the automatic installation.
After installing a mod, you have to start the game using the mod loader and in the game you have to load the mod in the mod manager, To load a mod click the plug icon in the mod manager page.
For security purposes mods are not automatically updated, each time a new mod update is available you have to download it manually OR you can use the mod ModUpdater by FranzFischer to get in-game updates.

The modloader menu in-game can be by default opened with F9
The modloader console in-game can be by default opened with F10

The mod manager have different status for mods : 
- Idle : The mod is not running/active.
- Running : The mod is running and should be working.
- Compiling : The mod is compiling.
- Errored : The mod is errored which means that it won't work. Please contact the mod author.

When you have an error in-game it'll also be shown in the bottom right corner of the screen with the amount of errors, more details about the error can be obtained by pressing F10 and looking for red text/errors in the console.
